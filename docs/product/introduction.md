# Introduction

Welcome to our guide on structuring CSS with conventions! This documentation is designed to help maintain your CSS
codebase effectively by adopting standardized conventions across all aspects of your styling process.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this guide is to promote consistency, maintainability, and scalability in your CSS architecture. By
following established conventions from Ember, SCSS, CSS, and SMACSS, you can streamline development workflows, enhance
collaboration among team members, and reduce the likelihood of CSS-related issues in your projects.

## Benefits

- **Consistency**: Ensure that your CSS code follows a predictable pattern, making it easier to understand and modify.
- **Maintainability**: Facilitate easier updates and maintenance of CSS styles by adhering to clear naming and
  organization principles.
- **Scalability**: Prepare your CSS for growth by structuring it in a way that accommodates larger projects and teams.
- **Improved Collaboration**: Foster better collaboration among team members as everyone follows the same set of
  guidelines and practices.

## Audience

This guide is intended for front-end developers, designers, and anyone involved in writing and maintaining CSS code.
Whether you are new to structured CSS or looking to refine your existing practices, you’ll find useful insights and
recommendations tailored to improve your CSS architecture.

## How to Use This Guide

Throughout this documentation, we will cover essential topics such as file organization, naming conventions, writing
classes, and using SMACSS (Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS). Each section will provide practical tips,
examples, and best practices to help you implement these conventions effectively in your projects.

## Conventions Covered

This guide integrates conventions and best practices from Ember, SCSS, CSS, and SMACSS:

- **Ember**: Structuring styles for components and routes/templates in an Ember application.
- **SCSS**: Leveraging SCSS for enhanced styling capabilities, including variables, mixins, and partials.
- **CSS**: Best practices for writing clear, maintainable CSS that aligns with industry standards.
- **SMACSS**: Implementing SMACSS principles for scalable and modular CSS architecture.

By integrating these conventions while preserving Ember's unique features and workflow, you’ll learn how to create a
more organized, maintainable, and scalable CSS codebase that meets the needs of modern web development.
