### Our Story

From the First Idea to the Final Product.

As global procurement managers working in the automotive industry, we were frustrated with all the data management and reporting our teams had to do on a daily basis. We found many tools on the market to digitize the operational purchasing, but what about software solutions to manage the strategic spend and truly increase profitability? What about tools that go below the surface, on a cost break down level and with a bottom-up approach, while not losing the focus on what needs to be accomplished? The complexity keeps increasing, yet we are using most of the same tools we had 15 to 20 years ago.

There had to be an easier way. We started to put a team together of established software developers, UI/UX designers and purchasing professionals. With extensive product development and through many workshops, brainstorming sessions, and industry feedback, we developed a product that is both unique and innovative. Lhotse Analytics utilizes the latest software technologies and applies Artificial Intelligence – combined from 30 years of experience in global procurement – paired with smart Algorithms.

The result: We created a lean and intuitive software product that can be tailored to each company, that empowers each purchasing professional and supports each user to manage their strategic spend more effectively and more efficiently than ever before.
